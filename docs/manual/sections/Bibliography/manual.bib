The evidence suggests that when Schedule 13D filers trade aggressively, both high-frequency and low-frequency measures of stock liquidity indicate a higher stock liquidity. Importantly, measures that have been used as direct proxies for adverse selection, such the Kyle (1985) lambda, the Easley et al. (1996) pin measure, and the Amihud (2002) illiquidity measure, suggest that the adverse selection is lower when informed trading takes place. The evidence is consistent with informed traders being more aggressive when measured stock liquidity is high.},

Probability functions are derived for the stationary distributions of the best bid and offer, conditional on the order flows. By identifying the unobservable order and acceptance flows, our estimation method permits the prediction of the stationary distributions of other market statistics. A test is proposed that allows a comparison of predicted and sample bid-ask spread distributions taking parameter estimation error into account. The methodology is applied to the screen-based interbank foreign exchange market, using continuously recorded quotes on the Deutschemark/US dollar exchange rate."
