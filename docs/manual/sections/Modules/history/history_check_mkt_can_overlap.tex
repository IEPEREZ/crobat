\paragraph{\textit{function} \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{chk\_mkt\_can\_overlap}}\texttt{(self, events, order\_type)}}\hfill\break
\noindent \textbf{Description:} passes the order\_type either market order or canceled order. If it was a market order checks for a recent canceled order of the same size and delectes the canceled order. likewise, if the ordertype passedwas a canceled order it looks for a recent market order and deletes the canceled order. 

The reason this is done this way is because the l2update channel only updates queue sizes while the ticker channel only announces market order arrivals.
