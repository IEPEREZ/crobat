\fbox{\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
		\texttt{on\_open} is called as soon as the initial WebSocket opening handshake is complete. The connection is open, but the client is not yet subscribed.
		
		If you override this method it is important that you still call it from your subclassâ€™ \texttt{on\_open} method, since the parent method sends the initial subscription request to the WebSocket server. Somewhere in your \texttt{on\_open} method you should have \texttt{super().on\_open()}.
		
		In addition to sending the subscription request, this method also logs that the connection was opened.
