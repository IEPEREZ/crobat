\section{Introduction} 
This project is an extension of my thesis, <a \href{"https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1682&context=hc_sas_etds"}{ A Study of CUSUM Statistics on Bitcoin Transactions}, where I was tasked with implementing CUSUM statistic processes to identify price actions periods in bitcoin markets. After developing a tool for market orders, the natural extension was to find relationships from activities in the limit order book. I started developing this tool to record instances of the limit order book in order to record Limit Order insertions (LO), cancellations (CO), and Market Orders (MO).

As the project grew I wanted to make a tool that could be used by academics looking to apply and develop market microstructure models in live markets. As a result, the styles in which the limit orderbook and orderbook events are recorded are being developed in accordance to the conventions presented in recent market microstructure papers correspond to the following papers:

\subsection{Orderbook updating}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Order book recording module that maintains a time-series of:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Limit order insertions, cancellations and market orders,
		\item volumes at $n^{\textrm{th}}$ best limits, and
		\item prices at  $n^{\textrm{th}}$ best limits.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{Getting Started and Installation}

\subsection{Installation}

Given that this is still very much a work in progress, it may make more sense to fork the project, or download the project as a compressed folder, and build \texttt{CSV\_out\_test.py} with your preferred settings.

\noindent \textbf{Note:} depending on the popularity of the asset and the computational power of your PC, you may run into errors arising from the computer not being able to keep up with the market (especially BTC-USD). I would suggest experimenting with an unpopular pair, (e.g.,  XRP-USD), or a crypto-crypto pair (e.g., XRP-BTC), and timing your queries outside of NYSE, and London Stock Exchange trading hours as they tend to have less activity.

however if you want an easy installation: 

```pip3 install crobat```
