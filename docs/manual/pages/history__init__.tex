\paragraph{\textit{function} \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{\_\_init\_\_}}\texttt{(self)}}\hfill\break
\textbf{Description:} Initializes the lists and variables that will be operated on by other class methods. Each side, bid, ask and the combined signed has a list demarked by \texttt{\_history}, that will be populated by timestamped states of the limit order book. The lists prefixed by \texttt{snapshot} are populated by the state of limit order book demarked by the suffix \texttt{bid}, \texttt{ ask}, and \texttt{signed}. The variables \texttt{order\_type},  \texttt{position} and \texttt{event\_size} denote the type, position and size of the event based on the change in the order book as a result of an \texttt{l2\_update} message. The \texttt{token} variable determines whether the change in the order book is recorded in the events list.
